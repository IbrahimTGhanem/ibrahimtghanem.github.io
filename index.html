  <ul>
    <li><em>Walkability and Health among Arab Communities in Metropolitan Toronto</em>, (2025–Present):
  Investigating how walkability influences health outcomes among racialized communities, with a focus on the Arab population. 
  The project collects and analyzes various types of primary and secondary data (e.g., census data, qualitative data, survey data, and spatial data) 
  to provide recommendations for public health and urban planning policies.

        Using data driven and community informed approaches, my work examines the relationship between a neighbourhood spatial conditions the well-being of resdients, as part of infomring health planning policies.

          Research interests: health/medical geography, neighbourhood environments and health, contextual and non-medical determinants of health, 
          physical activity, walkability, immigrants health, and spatial access to services.

          (e.g., Alsherif Al-Idrissi, Zakariya Al-Qzwini, and Abu El-Hasan El-Masudi), or discovering hiking trails and nature (See <a href="https://ibrahimtghanem.github.io/gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

         <h2>Overview of PhD Dissertation</h2>
        <p>
          The dissertation investigates how built-environment shapes the health and expeinces of Canadian racialized communities.
          <p>
          <ul class="theme-list">
          <li>The first part examines the association between objective walkability metrics and chronic diseases, with a focus on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. 
          <li>The second part shifts to understanding perceived walkability among racialized residents, through a mixed-methods approach that include participatory mapping and 
          analysis of neighbourhood characteristics. This understanding will help in adapting the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS) to reflect the experiences of 
          racialized populations in Canada. The adapted survey will be used to collect quantitative data and generate perceived walkability scores across a sample of neighbourhoods 
          in the Metropolitan Toronto. 
          <li>Lastly, the third part applies spatial econometrics and non-stationary methods to investigate the association between non-motorized access of racialized population 
          to basic amenities and health outcomes. 
          </ul>
          The findings of the dissertation are expected to guide interventions targeting chronic disease prevention and inform urban planning 
          strategies focusing on the creation of inclusive neighbourhoods.
           <p>
